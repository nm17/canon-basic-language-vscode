# Canon Basic Language support

Add support for Canon Basic Language. Currently only support code highlighting and it doesn't have any requirements or settings.

You can see the changelog in `CHANGELOG.md` file.

# How to build the extension from source

```sh
npm install && npm run convertYaml
# Install as usual
```

## Known Issues

  - `cbasic_support.yaml` may not contain all support functions that CBasic has. If you know more functions, let me know and I'll add them.
